## ü§ù Team Collaboration

We worked together to complete the project by dividing tasks clearly:

- **Ahmed** focused on writing the core logic, implementing specifiers, and refactoring the code using helper functions.
- **Munirah** handled documentation (`README.md`, `man_3_printf`), organized the directory structure, and created the test files to ensure functionality.

Commits from both contributors reflect consistent participation, responsibility division, and code collaboration.
